    <summary>How to Download MTWI-2018 Dataset</summary>

The COCO-Text images dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/137084?t=1687249173526)

The MTWI dataset has derived three tasks: Text Line(column) Recognition of Web Images, Text Detection of Web Images, and End to End Text Detection and Recognition of Web Images. The three tasks share the same training data: `mtwi_train.zip`; For test data, task1 has test data: `mtwi_task1.zip`, and task2/3 share the same test data: `mtwi_task2_3.zip`. For now, we will consider and download only the training data `mtw_train.zip`.

After downloading the dataset, unzip the file, after which the data structure should be like as follows (ignoring the archive files):
```txt
MTWI-2018
  |--- image_train
  |    |--- <image_name>.jpg
  |    |--- <image_name>.jpg
  |    |--- ...
  |--- txt_train
  |    |--- <image_name>.txt
  |    |--- <image_name>.txt
  |    |--- ...
```

## Data Preparation

### For Detection Task

To prepare the data for text detection, you can run the following commands:

```bash
python tools/dataset_converters/convert.py \
    --dataset_name mtwi2018 --task det \
    --image_dir path/to/MTWI-2018/image_train/ \
    --label_dir path/to/MTWI-2018/txt_train.json \
    --output_path path/to/MTWI-2018/det_gt.txt
```

Then you can have an annotation file in the standard form `det_gt.txt` under the folder `MTWI-2018/`.
