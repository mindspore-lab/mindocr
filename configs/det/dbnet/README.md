## 1. Introduction

DBNet is a segmentation-based scene text detection method. Segmentation-based methods are gaining popularity for scene
text detection purposes as they can more accurately describe scene text of various shapes, such as curved text.  
The drawback of current segmentation-based SOTA methods is the post-processing of binarization (conversion of
probability maps into text bounding boxes) which often requires a manually set threshold (reduces prediction accuracy)
and complex algorithms for grouping pixels (resulting in a considerable time cost during inference).  
To eliminate the problem described above, DBNet integrates an adaptive threshold called Differentiable Binarization(DB)
into the architecture. DB simplifies post-processing and enhances the performance of text detection.Moreover, it can be
removed in the inference stage without sacrificing performance.[[1](#references)]

<p align="center"><em>Figure 1. Overall DBNet architecture</em></p>

The overall architecture of DBNet is presented in _Figure 1._ It consists of multiple stages:

1. Feature extraction from a backbone at different scales. ResNet-50 is used as a backbone, and features are extracted
   from stages 2, 3, 4, and 5.
2. The extracted features are upscaled and summed up with the previous stage features in a cascade fashion.
3. The resulting features are upscaled once again to match the size of the largest feature map (from the stage 2) and
   concatenated along the channel axis.
4. Then, the final feature map (shown in dark blue) is used to predict both the probability and threshold maps by
   applying 3×3 convolutional operator and two de-convolutional operators with stride 2.
5. The probability and threshold maps are merged into one approximate binary map by the Differentiable binarization
   module. The approximate binary map is used to generate text bounding boxes.

> More information of DBNet++ is coming soon. The only difference between _DBNet_ and _DBNet++_ is in the _Adaptive Scale Fusion_ module, which is controlled by the `use_asf` parameter in the `neck` module in yaml config file.


#### Notes
- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS version}{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Note that the training time of DBNet is highly affected by data processing and varies on different machines. 



## 3. Quick Start

### 3.1 Installation

Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindocr#installation) in MindOCR.

### 3.2 Dataset preparation

Please download [ICDAR2015](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=downloads) dataset, and convert the labels to the desired format referring to [dataset_converters](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindocr/blob/main/tools/dataset_converters/README.md).


The prepared dataset file struture should be:  

``` text
.
├── test
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── img_1.jpg
│   │   ├── img_2.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── test_det_gt.txt
└── train
    ├── images
    │   ├── img_1.jpg
    │   ├── img_2.jpg
    │   └── ....jpg
    └── train_det_gt.txt
```

### 3.3 Update yaml config file

Update `configs/det/dbnet/db_r50_icdar15.yaml` configuration file with data paths,
specifically the following parts. The `dataset_root` will be concatenated with `dataset_root` and `label_file` respectively to be the complete dataset directory and label file path.

```yaml
...
train:
  ckpt_save_dir: './tmp_det'
  dataset_sink_mode: False
  dataset:
    type: DetDataset
    dataset_root: dir/to/dataset          <--- Update
    data_dir: train/images                <--- Update
    label_file: train/train_det_gt.txt    <--- Update
...
eval:
  dataset_sink_mode: False
  dataset:
    type: DetDataset
    dataset_root: dir/to/dataset          <--- Update
    data_dir: test/images                 <--- Update
    label_file: test/test_det_gt.txt      <--- Update
...
```

> Optionally, change `num_workers` according to the cores of CPU.



DBNet consists of 3 parts: `backbone`, `neck`, and `head`. Specifically:

```yaml
model:
  type: det
  transform: null
  backbone:
    name: det_resnet50  # Only ResNet50 is supported at the moment
    pretrained: True    # Whether to use weights pretrained on ImageNet
  neck:
    name: DBFPN         # FPN part of the DBNet
    out_channels: 256
    bias: False
    use_asf: False      # Adaptive Scale Fusion module from DBNet++ (use it for DBNet++ only)
  head:
    name: DBHead
    k: 50               # amplifying factor for Differentiable Binarization
    bias: False
    adaptive: True      # True for training, False for inference
```

[comment]: <> (The only difference between _DBNet_ and _DBNet++_ is in the _Adaptive Scale Fusion_ module, which is controlled by the `use_asf` parameter in the `neck` module.)

### 3.4 Training

* Standalone training

Please set `distribute` in yaml config file to be False.

```shell
python tools/train.py -c=configs/det/dbnet/db_r50_icdar15.yaml
```

* Distributed training

Please set `distribute` in yaml config file to be True.

```shell
# n is the number of GPUs/NPUs
mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 2 python tools/train.py --config configs/det/dbnet/db_r50_icdar15.yaml
```
 
The training result (including checkpoints, per-epoch performance and curves) will be saved in the directory parsed by the arg `ckpt_save_dir` in yaml config file. The default directory is `./tmp_det`.


### 3.5 Evaluation

To evaluate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `eval.py`. Please set the checkpoint path to the arg `ckpt_load_path` in the `eval` section of yaml config file, set `distribute` to be False, and then run:

```shell
python tools/eval.py -c=configs/det/dbnet/db_r50_icdar15.yaml
```
