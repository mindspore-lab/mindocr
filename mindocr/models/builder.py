    There are two ways to build a model.
        1. load a predefined model according the given model name.
        2. build the model according to the detailed configuration of the each module (transform, backbone, neck and head), for lower-level architecture customization.

    Args:
        config: if it is a str, config is the model name. Predefined model with weights will be returned.
                if dict, config is a dictionary and the available keys are:
                    model_name: string, model name in the registered models
                    pretrained: bool, if True, download the pretrained weight for the preset url and load to the network.
                    backbone: dict, a dictionary containing the backbone config, the available keys are defined in backbones/builder.py
                    neck: dict,
                    head: dict,
        kwargs: if config is a str of model name, kwargs servers as the args for the model.
